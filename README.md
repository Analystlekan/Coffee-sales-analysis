# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, I have created a comprehensive Excel dashboard to analyze coffee sales based on various attributes such as order details, customer information, and product specifics. The dataset includes information about order IDs, order dates, customer IDs, product IDs, quantities, customer names, emails, countries, coffee types, roast types, sizes, unit prices, and sales. The goal of this project is to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional sales distribution.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- **Order ID**: A unique identifier for each sales order.
- **Order Date**: The date when the order was placed.
- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer Name**: The name of the customer.
- **Email**: The email address of the customer.
- **Country**: The country where the sale was made.
- **Coffee Type**: The type of coffee sold.
- **Roast Type**: The roast type of the coffee (e.g., light, medium, dark).
- **Size**: The size of the coffee product.
- **Unit Price**: The price per unit of the coffee.
- **Sales**: The total sales amount for the order.

## Tools and Software

For this project, I used Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization. Excel provides a versatile and accessible platform for performing data analysis, creating charts, and building interactive dashboards.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Excel Dashboard**: The complete data analysis process, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
2. **Visualizations**: A variety of charts and graphs to support key findings and insights.
3. **Final Report**: A comprehensive summary of the analysis, insights, and recommendations.

## Visualizations

1. **Total Sales Over Time**: A line chart showing the total sales amount over time.

   
2. **Top 5 Customers**: A bar chart showing the top 5 customers based on total sales.

   
3. **Sales by Country**: A bar chart showing the distribution of sales across different countries.

## Conclusion

This data analysis project in Excel provides valuable insights into coffee sales and customer demographics. The interactive visualizations help in understanding various aspects of sales performance, such as total sales over time, top customers, and sales distribution by country. By the end of the project, we aim to uncover actionable recommendations that can drive improvements in sales strategies and enhance customer targeting, all within the user-friendly environment of Excel.
